## Data Analysis Projects

### [Providing Data-Driven Suggestions for HR](./MyFolder/HR%20project.ipynb)
- Developed within the Google Advanced Analytics Professional Certificate program, this project employed HR data to build a predictive model for employee attrition. Using the PACE model, we conducted EDA, generated insights, and split the data for training and testing. Models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were trained, evaluated, and compared using key metrics. The final model was utilized on test data to draw insights on employee attrition.


### [Weibull Calculation of Heat Exchanger Failure Data](./MyFolder/Weibull%20calculation.ipynb)
- This project involved the determination of Weibull parameters from failure data of multiple heat exchangers, utilizing survival analysis and incorporating both failed and censored data. The analysis is the first step towards calculating optimal replacement times for heat exchangers, enabling enhanced maintenance planning and minimizing repeat failures. Follow-up project: 'Optimal Replacement Time Calculation for Heat Exchangers.


### [Optimal Replacement Time Calculation for Heat Exchangers](./MyFolder/optimal%20repla%20time%20heat%20exch.ipynb)
- This project aimed to determine the optimal replacement time for heat exchangers using Weibull distribution parameters and triangular distribution costs of corrective and preventive replacements. The goal was to optimize replacement frequency and mitigate high failure rates.

### [Titanic Survival Prediction](./MyFolder/titanic_survival_prediction.ipynb)
- This project involved the development of a predictive model to understand what sorts of people were more likely to survive the sinking of the Titanic, one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. By using passenger data (name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.), the model aimed to shed light on whether certain groups of individuals had higher survival rates. The insights derived from this project are crucial in understanding the various socio-economic and demographic factors that might have influenced the survival of the passengers aboard the Titanic on its ill-fated maiden voyage.

## Business Intelligence Projects

### [Minnesota Department of Transportation Traffic Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julio.carrillo/viz/Minneapolistrafficvolume/Story1)
As a part of the Google BI Professional Certificate Project, I designed a comprehensive dashboard that captures essential traffic metrics for the Minnesota Department of Transportation.

**Key Features**:
- **Yearly Traffic Breakdown**: Visualized the traffic volume with granularity options, allowing users to filter by year, month, week, day, and hour.
- **Weather's Impact**: Integrated the `weather_main` column to display traffic variations across different weather conditions.
- **Holiday Analysis**: Developed insights into how traffic behaves on various holidays, leveraging both the `date_time` and a custom measure for holidays.

**Tools & Techniques**: Tableau Public, Data Manipulation, Visualization Design

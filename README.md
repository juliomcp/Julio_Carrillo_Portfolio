## Projects
- [Providing data-driven suggestions for HR](./MyFolder/HR%20project.ipynb)
   - Developed within the Google Advanced Analytics Professional Certificate program, this project employed HR data to build a predictive model for employee attrition. Using the PACE model, we conducted EDA, generated insights, and split the data for training and testing. Models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest were trained, evaluated, and compared using key metrics. The final model was utilized on test data to draw insights on employee attrition.
     
- [Weibull calculation of heat exchanger failure data](./MyFolder/Weibull%20calculation.ipynb)
   - This project involved the determination of Weibull parameters from failure data of multiple heat exchangers, utilizing survival analysis and incorporating both failed and censored data. The analysis is the first step towards calculating optimal replacement times for heat exchangers, enabling enhanced maintenance planning and minimizing repeat failures. Follow-up project: 'Optimal Replacement Time Calculation for Heat Exchangers.
     
- [Optimal replacement time calculation for heat exchangeers](./MyFolder/optimal%20repla%20time%20heat%20exch.ipynb)
   - This project aimed to determine the optimal replacement time for heat exchangers using Weibull distribution parameters and triangular distribution costs of corrective and preventive replacements. The goal was to optimize replacement frequency and mitigate high failure rates.

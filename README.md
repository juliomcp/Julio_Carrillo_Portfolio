## Business Intelligence Projects

### [Minnesota Department of Transportation Traffic Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/julio.carrillo/viz/Minneapolistrafficvolume/Story1)
As a part of the Google BI Professional Certificate, I collaborated with the Minnesota Department of Transportation to design a comprehensive dashboard that captures essential traffic metrics.

**Key Features**:
- **Yearly Traffic Breakdown**: Visualized the traffic volume with granularity options, allowing users to filter by year, month, week, day, and hour.
- **Weather's Impact**: Integrated the `weather_main` column to display traffic variations across different weather conditions.
- **Holiday Analysis**: Developed insights into how traffic behaves on various holidays, leveraging both the `date_time` and a custom measure for holidays.

**Tools & Techniques**: Tableau Public, Data Manipulation, Visualization Design

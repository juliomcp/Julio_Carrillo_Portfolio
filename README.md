## Projects
- [Providing data-driven suggestions for HR](./MyFolder/HR%20project.ipynb)
   - This project, from Google Advance Analytics Professional Certificate, had the of analyzing the data collected by an HR department and to build a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. The project followed the PACE (plan, analyze, construct, and execute) model to address the problem. This project involved first EDA (exploratory data analysis) and creating multiple plots like box, scatter and bar plots, heat correlation maps to draw initial conclusions and then splitting the data in training and testing data. Logistic regression, decision trees and random forest were completed with cross validation parameters and training data, then metrics AUC, precision, recall, accuracy and F-1 were used to compare, analyze and select the most appropriate model finally winner model was used on test data and conclusions were drawn.
     
- [Weibull calculation of heat exchanger failure data](./MyFolder/Weibull%20calculation.ipynb)
   - TThe goal of this project was to determine the Weibull parameters of failure data from multiple heat exchangers, using survival analysis and failed and censored data. This is step 1 for calculating optimal replacement time for heat exchangers so that maintenance plan could be optimized and be more efficient reducing repetitive failures. See next project on the list; Optimal replacement time calculation for heat exchangers.
     
- [Optimal replacement time calculation for heat exchangeers](./MyFolder/optimal%20repla%20time%20heat%20exch.ipynb)
   - The purpose of this project was to calculate, using Weibull distribution parameters, the optimal replacement time for heat exchangers based on corrective and preventive replacement triangular distribution costs in order to decide optimal frequency and minimize high rate of failures.
